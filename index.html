                Hello, I am Laila Walsh
            </h2>
            <p>
I am a freelance UX/UI designer based in Atlanta Georgia. Currently, my passion is to work with non-profits that would otherwise not be able to update their websites. My aim is to improve their websites so that users will gain a better experience and as a result of  my designs,  achieve a huge increase in traffic, create more awareness for their cause and an increase donations or volunteer applications. I have always volunteered and been involved in my communities since a young age so this  felt like a natural step for me following my studies in UX/UI design.
